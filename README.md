# About and Vision
For people who browse the internet who value an easy to upload, share and view content service; Postcard is a web-based service that allows users to upload images to the internet and create a sharable link that will allow users to view the images. Unlike Imgur/Photobucket/Flickr, our product would maintain anonymity by uploading images/albums without creating an account and allows simple shareable links. 

# Project Code
Postcard's main code can be found in the directory /project/src/main/

# Project Testing
Postcard's testcases utilizing Selenium and JUnit can be found under project/src/test/java/com/snorlax/SnorlaxApplicationTests.java

# Initial Prototype
An initial prototype to test Postcard's high level design using React, Spring Boot, and H2 Database can be found in the prototype directory. The functionality of the prototype is an example usage of the three components together and does not reflect Poostcard's functionality. Please refer to the Sept 27th commit for the prototype.
